Part of my experimental "portable python GUI program" setup using `shiv` and the
`embeddable zip` python release.

My program uses tkinter which the embeddable python zip doesn't include, so this
repo is the result of [following this SO answer][1].

There's also a zip-related bug in the 3.7.2 release so I worked around it by
extracting `python37.zip` to a folder with the same name.
